\lhead{Chapter 1. \emph{Introduction}} 

Begin with observational evidence of AGN.

\section{Active galactic nuclei}
\label{sec1:agn}
 
Describe the emission mechanisms of the AGN in each wavelength.

\section{Unified Model of AGN}
\label{sec1:um}

List all the regions of the unified model and where the emision mechanisms are originated.

\section{Classification of AGN}
\label{sec1:class}

Here we describe the classification and sublassification of AGN. We also describe other classifications.



\section{Absorption and obscuration}
\label{sec1:abs}

In this section we begin to introduce some aspects of importance in the thesis that are the diferences between X-ray and optical extinction of AGN. We point out the fraction of discordant sources and possible origin in the literature.




\section{Aims of this thesis}
