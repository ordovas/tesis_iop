AGN are found in surveys in X and then we look for counterparts in the optical. 

\section{XMM-Newton}
\label{sec2:rrhs}

Information about the XMM-newton cameras and how the X-ray data are procesed from the incoming radiation to the files (the post processing of the extraction of the sources and modeling of the spectra is not in this section)

\section{VLT/XSHOOTER}
\label{sec2:xhs}

Description about the XSHOOTER instrument, how the uv-to-nir radiation is divided and mention the echelle grating. Mention as well the ADC in this section. From the pipeline and reduction is in the following chapter. Maybe this section should be included in the optical telescopes


\section{Optical telescopes}
\label{sec2:hsamples}

For the optical observations of the sources. In order to identify all the xray sources, optical observations are made. Some of the optical counterparts comes from the SDSS public archive. Others are made using follow up observations. 

\subsection{GTC, VLT, ..}
\label{sec2:xhs}

Describe each telescope and where is located. After that describe the instrument, wavelenght coverage.


\subsection{SDSS}
\label{sec2:mirhs}

Description about the SDSS project, and the SDSS and BOSS instruments. We use until the SDSS-DR14 version.
