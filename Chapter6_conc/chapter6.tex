\section{Conclusions of this thesis}

\subsection{Detailed analysis of two X-ray unabsorbed type-2 objects}

We determined that the discordant optical and X-ray sources are not a physical family, as the origin of the discordance can be very different.

\subsection{Optical extinction and X-ray absorption of a complete type-1 sample}

The preliminar results obtained is that using a complete sample of X-ray selected type-1 AGN at hard energies we can detect objects with high levels of obscuration in the optical and in the X-rays. The majority of the sources follow the Galactic relation, but there are a significant fraction of discordant sources.


\section{Future work}

Here we explain possible studies that can be derived from this work, that could not be studied in this thesis.
